# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview
### Purpose
This project is intended to provide a clear analysis of performance trends and patterns from various schools and district levels. By looking at math and reading test scores of each student we are able to showcase trends in school performance in order to help the school board and superintendent make decisions for school budgets.
## Results 
Academic dishonesty was reported from the Thomas High School, since the ninth graders' scores are no longer viable for our report, we have replaced their scorees with a NaN and have constructed a new analysis report. 
### District Summary
The overall results did not change darastically from the original report before replacing the ninth grade scores. However, minor changes can be identified. 
   - The overall passing percentage from Thomas High school decreased by about .10% 
   - The overall school ranking was uneffected. The school sits second on the list with an overall passing rate of about 90% for a charter school.

### School Summary
Replacing the scores of the ninth graders' did however change the overall passing percentage for Thomas High School dropping to about 65%. The average scores for math and reading did increase by 0.06 once the ninth grade scores were exluded. 

By delving into this analysis, it can be determined that:
   - The average scores for math and reading per grade level do not depend on grade rather which school the student attends. 
   - The amount of money allocated to each student does not determine higher test scores. The top performing school gave about $60 dollars less to each student than the second and third top rated school. 
   - The school sizes for each high school, the lowest ranking schools were the ones with the largest student count and were also all district schools. 
   - From looking at the data the schools that produce the highest test scores are the ones that have a smaller student population and are charter schools. All top five ranking schools were in fact charter schools.

## Summary
Although it is not ideal to exclude an entire grades test scores, the overall results were not changed dramtically. Thomas High School's passing percent average did slightly decrease for both math and reading scores but by exluding the ninth grade scores the school was able to maintain their ranking as the second best school in the district.
